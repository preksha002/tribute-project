          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 â€“ 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, 
         anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful 
        campaign for India's independence from British rule,and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom 
        across the world. The honorific Mahatma(Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"),first applied to him in 1914 in South 
        Africa, is now used throughout the world.</p>

       <p>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, 
       London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to 
      start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893, to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. 
      He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family, and first employed 
       nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India. He set about organising 
       peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. 
      Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, 
      expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</p>
